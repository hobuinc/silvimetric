# About

Summarizing and filtering point cloud data into useful information for modeling
is challenging. In forestry applications in particular, the {{ FUSION }} software toolkit
is often used to extract information in preparation for modeling. FUSION, however,
has a few missing features that make it

Working with Bob McGaughey and the USFS GTAC team, Kyle Mann and Howard Butler from
{{ HOBU }}, developed the initial prototype of SilviMetric to implement an alternative
approach to computing the "GridMetrics" component of typical {{ FUSION }} processing
pipelines.

SilviMetric does this by breaking apart the computation of metrics into three
distinct steps â€“ {ref}`info`, {ref}`shatter`, and {ref}`extract`. SilviMetric takes
an infrastructure computing approach to the challenge by applying emerging open
source technologies that speak cloud, are nimble with data formats, and compute
in a more friendly language - {{ Python }}.

## Technologies

SilviMetric stands on the shoulders of giants to provide an integrated solution to
computing rasterized point cloud metrics. These technologies include:

- {{ PDAL }} reads point cloud content and allows users to filter or process data
  as it ingested.
- {{ Dask }} processes tasks for :ref\`shatter\` and {ref}`extract` in a highly
  parallel, cloud-friendly distributed computing environment.
- {{ TileDB }} stores metrics in cloud object stores such as {{ S3 }} in addition to
  typical filesystems.
- {{ Python }} computes metrics and provides a diverse and convenient computing
  capability for users to easily add and extract their own metrics to the database.
